# workspace
A place where all my work comes together

# Vision
I would like to be able to have all of the things I am currently managing together in one single place.
This application is the place where eventually my Zettelkasten, task management, investments, reading list and code & text editor come together. I will build this application with only me and my productivity in mind.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Task manager
  - [ ] Integration with Jira
  - [ ] Pivot tracking
